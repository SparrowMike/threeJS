# Three.js Learning Project
Welcome to my Three.js learning project! In this repository, I'm following the official Three.js documentation to learn how to create 3D scenes using JavaScript.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into different folders, each containing specific components of the application. As I progress through the documentation, I'll be adding more to each folder.

## 'src' Folder
The src folder is where the main source code of the project resides. Here's what's currently inside:

index.html: The main HTML file that includes the canvas element and sets up the basic structure of the webpage.

index.js: The entry point JavaScript file that initializes the Three.js scene, camera, geometry, and rendering.

node_modules Folder
The node_modules folder contains the external dependencies required for this project. I'm using Three.js library to create and manipulate 3D graphics.

assets Folder
In the assets folder, I'll be storing any external resources that are used in the project, such as textures, images, and models. As I progress, I might add more resources here.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
You should see a basic 3D cube rendered on the webpage. As I continue learning, I'll be updating and adding more features to this project.

Documentation Progress
As of now, I've covered the fundamental concepts of setting up a basic Three.js scene, camera, and geometry. I've added comments in the code to explain each step. In the future, I'll be adding more folders, files, and explanations as I explore more advanced topics in Three.js.

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with my learning journey!

Remember, your README should be a reflection of your project's current state and your learning progress. As you continue learning and adding more features, you can update the README accordingly to provide clear information about the project's structure and purpose.
